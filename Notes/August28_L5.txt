Let's assume that the 
- p dentoes the probability of a successful search (1-p = probability of unsuccessful search)
- The probability of the first match occuring in the ith position of the list is the same for every i 

in the case of a successful search, the probabiliity of the first match occuring in the ith position of the list for every i, and the number of comparisons made by the algo is i.

Cavg(n) = [1 * (p/n) + 2 * (p/n) + .... + i * (p/n) + 1] n(1-p) = 
= (p(n+1))/2 + n-np
